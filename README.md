# ChartHop, React Technical Screener

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Actions

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. \
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## The Challenge

To complete this challenge, you will:
- Copy the files to a new repository on your personal GitHub account
- Solve the technical problem described below
- Explain your solution to the problem
- Share your repository with the ChartHop team

### The Problem

As it stands, the header renders itself on every keystroke to the search input. This is indicated by the `Header` component as a message, "Header rendered {n} times". In this exercise, you are asked to modify the app so that the header does not re-render when a new keystroke is entered into the search input. This task must be accomplished without changing the signatures of any functions or functional components.

### The Solution

Once you've arrived at a solution, please add a paragraph to this README, describing the nature of the problem you fixed (why did the app render on every keystroke?), the solution you provided, and an explanation as to why your solution corrects the problem. When you're ready, please share your repository with the ChartHop team. Specific sharing accounts will be provided via email.
